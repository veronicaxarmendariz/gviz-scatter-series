gviz-scatter-series
===================

Use this template to create a custom interactive scatter chart (to visualize relationship between X-Y data), with options for multiple data series/legend and data labels in the text tooltip. It draws data from a Google Spreadsheet using Google Visualization API. Requires a free Google Drive account and text editor, and ability to modify spreadsheet and HTML templates as instructed.
